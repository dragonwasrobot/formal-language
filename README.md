Formal Language
======================

## What is this?
A small project to provide working implementations of different constructs used
in formal language theory, e.g. Finite Automatas, Push-down Automatas and a
Turing Machine.

## To-do

* General.
  * Improve robustness of tests.

* Finite Automata.
  * Fill out all the remaining stubs.
  * Sanity check input:
    * Alphabet shouldn't be able to use special symbols.
    * Alphabet symbols have length 1.
  * Refactor:
    * Improve intersection/union/minus algorithm so that it uses a DFS.
  * Documentation.
  * Create a set of test machines.

* Nondeterministic Finite Automata.
  * Implement one.

* Push-down Automata.
  * Implement one.

* Turing Machine
  * Refactor
  * Create a set of test machines.
